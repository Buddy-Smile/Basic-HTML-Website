<h1>I LOVE COFFEE!</h1>
<h3>Angharad Brewer Gillham Said " Drinking coffee increases alertness and prepares
people to switch from rest to task mode more so than just consuming caffeine."</h3>

<b>Coffee</b> is one of the most popular beverages in the world, and for good reason.
It's delicious, it's energizing, and it can help us to focus and be more productive.
But what is it about coffee that makes it so effective?
One reason is that coffee contains caffeine, a stimulant that blocks the effects of adenosine,
a neurotransmitter that makes us feel tired. When we drink coffee, the caffeine binds to the
adenosine receptors in our brains, preventing adenosine from attaching to them. This results
in a decrease in fatigue and an increase in alertness.
However, there is more to coffee than just caffeine. Recent research has shown that the full
coffee experience, not just caffeine, helps to enhance alertness and cognitive readiness.
In one study, researchers found that drinking coffee decreased the connectivity of the brain's
default mode network (DMN). The DMN is involved in introspection and daydreaming, and it is
less active when we are focused on tasks. The researchers found that drinking coffee decreased
the connectivity of the DMN more so than just consuming caffeine.
The researchers also found that drinking coffee increased connectivity in the higher visual
network and the right executive control network. These networks are involved in working memory
and cognitive control, which are important functions for completing tasks.
The researchers concluded that the full coffee experience, including the aroma, taste, and
social aspects of drinking coffee, may contribute to its ability to increase alertness and
cognitive readiness.
So next time you're feeling tired and need a boost, reach for a cup of coffee. It's not just
the caffeine that's helping you to wake up and focus; it's the whole coffee experience.
